# Library Usage Info
A simple Python script for gathering library information from different sources and grouping them into a nice readable format to quickly see where and which version is used.

It checks the Gitlab repo of the library and the Nexus to find which library version exist and compares this data to the Gitlab repo of the project using your library as a dependency.

It generates an HTML page and publishes it on the Confluence.
